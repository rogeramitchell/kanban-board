# kanban-board

Working on how to create a set of cards and columns in an attractive layout that allows users to view data in a kanban board / cardwall format. Users are able to drag cards with position between columns.

## Short Term Goals

- Create a nice layout and experience as a static page
- Read data from a Salesforce object to populate the wall
- Push updates back to the underlying object

## Longer Term Goals

- Abstract the code to allow users to configure the page based on their Salesforce object use case
	- Fields that appear on each card
	- Column groupings
	- Sort order of cards
